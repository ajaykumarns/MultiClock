MultiClock
==========

Support for multiple timezone display from menubar. I developed this app because I was tired of the default Mac's time app. Since I work with folks from multiple timezones, I wanted to add multiple instances of time to my menubar. However, that wasn't supported by Mac.

So, I ended up developing a simple app that allows you to add new time zones that you wanna look at with just a single click. (No, I don't want to use the dashboard.)

If you are looking for a solution to the same problem here it is... Just download the app file and start using it! Here is a sample screenshot:
